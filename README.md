Ever since I was a kid, I'd always wondered how things work on the internet which made me eager to learn something about how the internet works and that's when I learned to create web pages for the first time. Gradually, learned full-stack Web Development practicing various courses on the online platform.

This passion carried me to my education in the field of Computer Engineering at Trinity College Dublin and Thapar Institute. And it was here when I learned how much there was yet to learn. Which later drove me towards Artificial Intelligence. So I've started learning Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

So far, I've Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, Django, MongoDB, MySQL, Git/GitHub under my belt. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my mind.
